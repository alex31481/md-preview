# md-preview
A cross platform tool for previewing markdown files. This project implements the same style as Github. This is something I hacked together using BrowserSync and a very small angularJS app in about 2 hours. It has very little code. I am very new to the javascript. This is my first npm module. Please let me know if there is anything silly I am doing here.
